Let {the digits} always be a list of "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"

To try to extract a number from {some text}:
- Given {the text} as some {text}.
- Provides {the number} as a {whole number}.
- Provides {the remainder} as some {text}.
- Remove {1} character from the start of {the line}, providing {the prefix} as {the character} and {the suffix} as {the remainder}!
- If {the character} is included in {the digits}:
  - Provide the index of {the character} as {the number}. 
  - Provide {the remainder}.
- Otherwise:
  - Fail

To get {the partial calibration value} for {a line}:
- Given {the line} as some {text}.
- Provides {the partial calibration value} as a {whole number}.
- Let {the numbers} be an empty list.
- While {the line} is not empty:
  - Try to extract a number from {the line}, providing {the number} and {the remainder}:
    - Let {the line} be {the remainder}.
    - Add {the number} to {the numbers}.
  - Otherwise:
    - Remove {1} character from the start of {the line}, providing {the the suffix}!
    - Let {the line} be {the suffix}
- Provide (the first value of {the numbers}) * 10 + (the last value of {the numbers})) as {the partial calibration value}.  


To get {the calibration value} for {an input}:
- Given {the input} as some {text}.
- Provides {the calibration value} as a {whole number}.
- Let {the total} be 0.
- For each line of {the input} as {the line}:
  - Add {the partial calibration value} for {the line} to {the total}.
- Provide {the total} as {the calibration value}

Let {the sample input} be:
```text
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```
Expect {the calibration value} for {the sample input} to be 281

Let {the full input} be {the contents} of the file {"2023-12-01-input.txt"}.
Expect {the calibration value} for {the full input} to be 56397.
